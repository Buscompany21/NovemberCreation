## Instructions for Use

STEP 1: 

Download the Dockerfile to your working directory.

STEP 2:

Build the new container image with this command:

` docker build -t november-creation .`

After the build, you should see this:

STEP 3:

Now, run this command to start a real container based on the image you just built. The -it is important because that lets you tty into the container.

`docker run -it -d november-creation`

You should see this when you run the command:

STEP 4:

To access your machine, go to docker desktop and find your running container. You may access the terminal and run commands in the container here:

Or you may more directly access the machine by copying the output from `run` and loading it into this command:

`docker exec -it <your output here> /bin/sh`

This option looks like this:

## Test Cases
The Docker configuration file includes commands to provide the version information about each of the applications. When building the configuration for Docker, the successful installation of each of the applications specified will be indicated by the running of the version information. The version number of all the tools is stored in ToolVersions.txt within the home directory.
